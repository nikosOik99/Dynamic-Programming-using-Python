# Dynamic-Programming-using-Python

This programming exercise in Python, <i>part of the Data Structures and Algorithms </i> MSc course, involves conducting an online auction. The task is based on the 0-1 knapsack problem, solved using dynamic programming. Christie's auction house has N identical diamonds for auction, with M buyers each submitting a bid of the form <i>"I want to buy Ki diamonds for Ei euros."</i> Each bid can either be accepted in full or rejected entirely. The goal is to maximize Christie's profit by selecting the optimal set of bids, selling up to N diamonds.
